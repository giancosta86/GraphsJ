Download and decompress the binary zip archive\r\n2. Run the file *bin/GraphsJ* (on UNIX) or *bin/GraphsJ.bat* (on Windows)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Online help\r\n\r\nGraphsJ features a very user-friendly interface, but ideas and suggestions can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/giancosta86/GraphsJ/wiki)!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Scenario development kit\r\n\r\nFor detailed information, please refer to the [SDK project page](https://github.com/giancosta86/GraphsJ-sdk).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n![Drawing](screenshots/Drawing.png)\r\n\r\n![Main window](screenshots/MainWindow.png)\r\n\r\n![Splash screen](screenshots/SplashScreen.png)\r\n\r\n![Installing scenarios](screenshots/InstallingScenarios.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Special thanks\r\n\r\nThe icons in the menu and toolbar are part of the [Crystal Clear icon set](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Clear), by [Everaldo Coelho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everaldo_Coelho).\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to:\r\n\r\n* [Professor Silvano Martello](http://www.or.deis.unibo.it/staff_pages/martello/cvitae.html)\r\n* [Claudia D'Ambrosio](http://www.or.deis.unibo.it/staff_pages/dambrosio/cv_claudia_english.htm)\r\n\r\nfor their suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Further references\r\n\r\n* [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/graphsj)\r\n\r\n* [GraphsJ Scenario Development Kit](https://github.com/giancosta86/GraphsJ-sdk)\r\n\r\n* [GraphsJ - Scenarios](https://github.com/giancosta86/GraphsJ-scenarios)\r\n\r\n* [EighthBridge](https://github.com/giancosta86/EighthBridge)\r\n\r\n* [MoonDeploy](http://gianlucacosta.info/moondeploy)",
