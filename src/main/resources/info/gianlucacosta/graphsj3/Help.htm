    <h2>Basic canvas instructions</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Left-click in the empty space to create a new vertex
        </li>

        <li>
            Left-click on a vertex or link to select it.
            To ease link selection, links become faded when the mouse
            cursor hovers over them
        </li>

        <li>
            Select a single vertex (by left-clicking on it), then
            right-click on another vertex to create a link
        </li>

        <li>
            Left-click in the empty space and drag the mouse to define
            a selection rectangle, that will select any vertex or link
            within its boundaries
        </li>

        <li>
            When one or more vertexes are selected, left-click and drag
            any of them to move the entire selection
        </li>

        <li>
            Use CTRL and left-click to add/remove vertexes/links to the
            current selection - both the single click and the selection
            rectangle are suitable for this operation
        </li>

        <li>
            Right-click on a link to create an internal link point
        </li>

        <li>
            Left-click on an internal link point and drag it to move it,
            or right-click on it to delete it
        </li>


        <li>
            Double-click on a vertex or link to edit its properties
            (different scenarios support different properties, and some
            scenarios might even not support vertex/link properties at all)
        </li>

        <li>
            When a single vertex or link is selected, press ENTER
            to edit its properties (it's equivalent to double-clicking
            the item)
        </li>

        <li>
            Left-click and drag a link label to move it; in this case,
            whenever you hover the mouse cursor over either that label or its
            related link, a segment joining them will appear.
        </li>

        <li>
            Press DEL to remove the selected items
        </li>
    </ul>
